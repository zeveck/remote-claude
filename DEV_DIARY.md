### Session 5: Documentation Maintenance Optimization
**Date**: Current Session  
**Focus**: Optimizing documentation maintenance from hooks to steering

#### Documentation Maintenance Challenge
**Issue Identified**: Hook-based documentation maintenance was inconsistent
- Hooks for pre-commit documentation updates weren't firing reliably
- Multiple hooks created redundancy and token waste
- Timing issues with "about to commit" triggers
- User had to manually remind about documentation updates

**Solution Implemented**: Transition to Steering-Based Maintenance
- Replaced multiple hooks with single steering rule in `.kiro/steering/documentation.md`
- Steering rule always active (no trigger timing issues)
- Lower token cost (included in context vs separate executions)
- More reliable "always remember" behavior
- Automatic documentation check when user mentions committing

#### Benefits Achieved
✅ **Consistent Documentation Updates**: Steering rules are always active  
✅ **Reduced Token Cost**: No separate hook executions needed  
✅ **Eliminated Timing Issues**: No trigger detection problems  
✅ **Simplified Maintenance**: One rule instead of multiple hooks  
✅ **Better User Experience**: Automatic documentation awareness  

This optimization ensures documentation stays current without the reliability issues experienced with hook-based approaches.

### Session 9: Security Enhancements and Interface Polish (v0.1.2)
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Focus**: Mobile password security and interface refinements

#### Mobile Password Security Issue
**Critical Security Problem Identified**:
- Android GBoard in Chrome was showing password characters briefly before masking
- Characters were visible long enough for shoulder surfing attacks
- Standard `type="password"` attribute wasn't sufficient on mobile

**Security Enhancements Implemented**:
- Added `spellcheck="false"` to prevent password caching in spellcheck dictionaries
- Added `autocorrect="off"` to disable mobile autocorrect processing
- Added `autocapitalize="off"` to prevent automatic capitalization
