# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables remote access to Claude Code functionality through a secure web interface, allowing users to interact with Claude from mobile devices or remote locations. The system provides a desktop server that hosts a web interface, enabling secure command execution and file browsing within authorized directories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely access Claude Code from my mobile device, so that I can get coding assistance even when away from my desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL require SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
2. WHEN the user attempts to access the interface THEN the system SHALL require password authentication before granting access
3. WHEN the user provides correct credentials THEN the system SHALL grant access to the web interface
4. WHEN the user provides incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the server to use proper authentication mechanisms, so that unauthorized users cannot access my Claude interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the server THEN the system SHALL store passwords using SHA-256 hashing with salt
2. WHEN storing authentication data THEN the system SHALL save hashed credentials to a passwd.txt file
3. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL compare hashed passwords rather than plaintext
4. WHEN generating SSL certificates THEN the system SHALL create self-signed certificates for HTTPS communication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control which directories Claude can access, so that I can maintain security and privacy of sensitive files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the server THEN the system SHALL allow specification of authorized directories in an allow-dirs.txt file
2. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown containing only the allowed directories
3. WHEN a user selects a directory from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL switch to that directory context
4. WHEN loading the directory selection interface THEN the system SHALL only populate the dropdown with directories from the allowed list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse files in authorized directories through the web interface, so that I can see the current state of my project files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing an authorized directory THEN the system SHALL display a file browser showing directory contents
2. WHEN viewing files THEN the system SHALL show file names, sizes, and modification dates
3. WHEN navigating subdirectories THEN the system SHALL maintain security restrictions within the allowed directory tree
4. WHEN displaying file contents THEN the system SHALL provide read-only access to file contents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send commands to Claude through the web interface, so that I can get coding assistance and file modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a command THEN the system SHALL pass the command to Claude Code in the selected directory context
2. WHEN Claude processes a command THEN the system SHALL return Claude's complete response to the web interface
3. WHEN Claude modifies files THEN the system SHALL update the file browser to reflect changes
4. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current directory context for Claude

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple setup process for the server, so that I can quickly get the remote access working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the server THEN the system SHALL provide a command to generate SSL certificates
2. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL provide a command to set the password
3. WHEN configuring directory access THEN the system SHALL provide a command to set allowed directories
4. WHEN starting the server THEN the system SHALL provide a simple command to launch the web server
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL display the URL and port for browser access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a responsive web interface, so that I can effectively use the system on my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from a mobile device THEN the web interface SHALL be responsive and mobile-friendly
2. WHEN typing commands THEN the interface SHALL provide an appropriate input method for mobile devices
3. WHEN viewing Claude responses THEN the text SHALL be readable and properly formatted on small screens
4. WHEN browsing files THEN the file browser SHALL be navigable on touch devices
