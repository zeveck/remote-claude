# Documentation Maintenance

Always keep these files up to date when making changes:
- DEV_DIARY.md (add session notes for significant work)
- CHANGE_LOG.md (update for releases/major features)
- README.md (keep current with features/setup)
- TEST_SUMMARY.md (update when tests change)

When the user mentions committing or asks to commit, automatically check and update these files first.

TASKS.md should not be updated, it is now archival.
